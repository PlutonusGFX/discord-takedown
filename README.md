# Welcome to Discord Takedown.

**Discord has an API for creating bots that can moderate Discord servers and Discord users alike, and there are limits to how this API is used called the API Terms of Service. This application does abuse the Discord API and should not be used directly. This was created for educational purposes only.**

## Getting Started

To use this bot *(which is not recommended)*, simply edit the `config.sample.json` file, and enter your user Token.

## Todo List

This is a one-man project and I have no considerations for your needs / wants, but I'll try to keep track of what I'd like done.

###### V2 Goals
- [ ] Support multi-channel spamming
- [ ] Remove all roles from everyone
- [ ] Create multiple invite links
- [ ] Create webhooks
